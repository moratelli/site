# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! Welcome to my personal blog. After working on my portfolio site for a while, I decided it was time to add a blog section where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and technical learnings.

## What You'll Find Here

I plan to write about:

- **Software Development**: React, TypeScript, and modern web development
- **Career Growth**: Lessons learned from working at companies like Philips and Zallpy
- **Travel & Life**: My experiences living in Brazil and Canada
- **Projects**: Deep dives into interesting technical challenges

## Why I Built This

I wanted a simple, fast blog that:

1. Uses markdown for easy writing
2. Integrates seamlessly with my existing portfolio
3. Supports code syntax highlighting for technical posts
4. Maintains the same design language

## What's Next

Stay tuned for more posts about React, TypeScript, and my journey in software development!

Thanks for reading 🚀
