summary: |
  I'm a hands-on Tech Lead with over 5 years of experience bringing complex software to life for global clients like BMW Group, Philips, and Siemens. I build scalable APIs and high-performance apps with Node.js, .NET, Flutter, and React but what really drives me is helping teams find better, clearer ways to deliver reliable software that users love. I thrive on tackling tough technical challenges and breathing new life into legacy systems so they can grow with the business. Leading with mentorship and a focus on clear communication, I lean on Flow Metrics not just as numbers but as a way to make delivery predictable and less stressful for everyone whether my team is across the desk or halfway around the world. Before tech, I worked in education which shaped how I lead by valuing empathy, communication, and team wellbeing as the foundation for building strong, collaborative teams. Fluent in English and French, I love working in distributed environments where diverse perspectives create truly global impact.
